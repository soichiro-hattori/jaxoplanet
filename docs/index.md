# jaxoplanet

_Astronomical time series analysis with JAX_

---

_jaxoplanet_ is an implementation of many features from the
[exoplanet](https://docs.exoplanet.codes/en/latest/) and
[starry](https://starry.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) packages built on top of
[JAX](https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

*jaxoplanet* includes fast and robust implementations of many exoplanet-specific
operations, including solving Kepler's equation, and computing limb-darkened
light curves.

Since all *jaxoplanet* operations are written in JAX, they have first-class
support for hardware acceleration using GPUs and TPUs.

*jaxoplanet* is built on top of JAX, which means that it integrates seamlessly
with modeling tools like [NumPyro](https://numpyro.readthedocs.io/en/latest/),
and [Flax](https://flax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

## Installation

You'll first need to install JAX following [the instructions in the JAX
docs](https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#installation). For example, to
install the CPU version of JAX, you can run:

```bash
python -m pip install "jax[cpu]"
```

Then install _jaxoplanet_ with:

```bash
python -m pip install jaxoplanet
```
