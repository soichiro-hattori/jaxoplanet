    "## Solving Kepler's equation\n",
    "\n",
    "One core piece of infrastructure provided by `jaxoplanet` is a function to solve Kepler's equation\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "M = E - e \\sin(E)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "for the eccentric anomaly $E$ as a function of the eccentricity $e$ and mean anomaly $M$.\n",
    "This an important operation for many exoplanet models since the eccentric anomaly describes the motion of a bound two body gravitational system.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a lot of literature dedicated to solving this equation efficiently and robustly, and we won't get into all the details here, but there are a few points we should highlight:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The methods that are most commonly used in astrophysics to solve this equation are all iterative, using some sort of root finding scheme. While these methods can work well, they tend to be less computationally efficient than non-iterative approaches. Even more importantly for our purposes, non-iterative methods are better suited to massively parallel compute architectures like GPUs. These non-iterative methods typically have a two step form: (i) make a good initial guess (\"starter\") for $E$, then (ii) use a high order root finding update to refine this estimate. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. In most Python codes, the Kepler solver is offloaded to a compiled library, but we will find that we can get comparable performance just using JAX, and relying on its JIT compilation to accelerate the computation.\n",
    "\n",
    "With these points in mind, we can implement the solver that is included with `jaxoplanet`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Pure-Python (+JAX) solver\n",
    "\n",
    "The solver that we use in `jaxoplanet` is based on the method from [Markley (1995)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1995CeMDA..63..101M/abstract).\n",
    "It is possible to get better CPU performance using more sophisticated methods (see, for example, [Raposo-Pulido & PelÃ¡ez 2017](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2017MNRAS.467.1702R/abstract), and the follow up [Brandt et al. 2021](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021AJ....162..186B/abstract)), but these methods are somewhat harder to implement efficiently using JAX's programming model, and we expect that they would not be so easily extensible to GPU or TPU acceleration.\n",
    "Regardless, we find that JAX's JIT compilation allows us to achieve nearly state-of-the-art runtime performance, even with this simple method.\n",
    "\n",
    "First we implement a \"starter\" function which uses Markley's approximation to estimate $E$ as a function of $M$ and $e$:"
